# Multiserver Plugin

This plugin provides support for a number of devices by wrapping a VRPN driver.

As such, it is very useful at runtime, but it is **not a good example** if you are writing your own plugin from scratch. See the examples folder (under `share/doc/osvr-core/examples` in built snapshots) for better examples.
